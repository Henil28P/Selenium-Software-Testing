# Selenium-Software-Testing

Automating key functionalities tests and verification of any web application with Selenium framework to write automated tests and Ruby for supporting the tests structure.

Background:
Selenium is one of the most popular tools for testing web-based applications. It allows QA engineers to write and automate tests across many different browsers and operating systems, without a special scripting language. This project introduces Selenium to new users, covering installation and basic use cases. Find out how to set up the test-writing framework, WebDriver, and Selenium Grid, which allows you to distribute the testing load and run tests against a remote server. Learn best practices to write effective tests using variables and functions, and to organize tests into suites that can scale over time. Instructor Meaghan Lewis—a QA engineer at GitHub—also explains the test pyramid paradigm, which details an ideal way to balance unit, integration, and UI testing.

Selenium is a software testing framework that supports all major programming languages, platforms and browsers. It offers a variety of testing tools for all users and it is compatible with other frameworks and applications and it is an open-source tool making it accessible for everyone.

Ruby is used in this project in order to write and run test examples. Several methods to install Ruby are: Package managers, installers, managers and source. This project uses 'rvm' manager of Ruby to install Ruby.

Installation for Ruby using rvm for Mac:

1. $ \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --> to install the latest stable version of rvm
2. $ rvm --> to see the list of options available for rvm
3. $ rvm install 2.5.1 (or rvm install 3.2.0) to install the Ruby's latest stable version
